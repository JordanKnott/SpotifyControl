# SpotifyControl
A simple AutoHotKey script that lets you control Spotify through global hotkeys. 
Eventually this will be hooked up to an actual device controled by an Arduino, that will allow a button press to control Spotify.

## Controls ##

__Alt + Shift + P__: Pauses the current song.

__Alt + Shift + N__: Skips the current song.

__Alt + Shift + O__: Toggles the sound. ( It'll lower the volume to min or max, be careful with your ears! )

__Alt + Shift + T__: Shows the current playing song in the system tray.
